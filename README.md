# Jam-Wheel
## What is this?
This is a web application for users to jam together! Just enter a room ID and username, and you're connected to users in that room. Play notes on the jam wheel to make beats with other users.

## Technologies
This is using a Flask and Javascript stack, powered by the [Flask-SocketIo](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension as well as the [SocketIO](https://socket.io/) client library. The music components are written using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), and the visualization is written with the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

## Development
This application is still under development, there's still a lot of work to do!
#Incoming Features
- More sounds, specifically percusive instruments. New synth sounds would be better too.
	- Improved sound design.
- Improved visual feedback from user's emitting notes in the room.
- Displaying users in the room with the user.
